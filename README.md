your guide to date night planning

1. This webpage allows users to select basic movie filter options of 1. Genre & 2. Rating. Once selected and launched a list of movies that match that specific the options the user selected. 

2. The list of movies contain an image, the title, the rating and a brief description of the movie. The user will have the option to select the movie they would like to watch.
  
  a. The list of movies is provided by using The Movie DB API, as this API allowed us to narrow the search criteria to genre and rating, while populating the information we are looking for.

3. Once the user has selected a movie, the next page will launch, providing the user with a list of recipes to choose from that would match the movie style. The recipe's display a picture of the food as well as a name of what the food is. 

  a. the list of recipes is provided by the Tasty API, as this API allowed us to narrow down the dietary option that we will install later in the program, while populating the information we are looking for

4. Once the user selects the recipe, the next page will launch displaying both the movie and the recipe that the user selected and provide them with a date package. The information provided is the exact same from each of the pages (movie & recipe)
